Overview

This project explores suicide trends in OECD countries, focusing on the relationships between socioeconomic factors (GDP, HDI, age) and suicide rates. The analysis also compares Israel, Austria, and Switzerland to uncover unique patterns and insights.


Dataset

The dataset includes 38 OECD countries and spans multiple years, with information on:

Country, Year, Gender, Age
Number of Suicides, Population
GDP, HDI, Generation
Suicides per 100,000 People
Key Objectives

Analyze Trends:

Impact of conscription and wars on suicide rates.
Correlation between GDP, HDI, and suicide rates.
Country Comparisons:

Compare Israel, Austria, and Switzerland.
Highlight suicide trends by gender and age.

Visualizations:

Use graphs to uncover patterns and relationships.

Key Findings

Conscription and Wars: Minimal impact on suicide rates.
GDP and HDI: Higher GDP/HDI correlates with lower suicide rates.

Age: Older age groups consistently show higher suicide rates.
